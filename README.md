# Blab
repository for storing and sharing code for B-Lab



Organization:

visuals_examples folder contains example charts and visuals realted to the air quality project. These should not be interpreted as final visualizations, but instead as a sort of menu of some options that code is currently available for.

data_code folder contains R scripts that take csv data on air quality or weather and perform the transformations and reorganization needed for this project. In general, these scripts are then saving the transformed tibbles as .feather files, which are then read by the chart scripts without reperforming the same operations. 

chart_code folder contains R scripts creating charts and visualizations for the air quality or weather data.


Intended Use: 

This repository is intended to be a way to pass on new code to the B-lab and to get requests or feedback back. This is not intended to be the working directory where master copies of the raw data lives, or where any final products are stored or shared. Instead, this is a place where I can pass on any code that write for you, update it, and make it freely available for the B-lab to use. 


Communication: 

For urgent matters, please reach out via phone or email. For less urgent requests, and to communicate details about things that you'd like changed or new scripts you would like, please use the "Issues" tab and create a new issue. 


Thanks!!!
Owen
